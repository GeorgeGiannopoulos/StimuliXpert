# StimuliXpert

**StimuliXpert improves the synchronization between EEG signals and emotional stimulus and records the user's emotional arousal & valence in real time**

The StimuliXpert software was designed to optimize the brain-computer interface cycle:
- Improves the synchronization between brain signals and the emotional stimulus as presented to the subject
- Compatibility with a variety of audiovisual files format that can be presented to the subject
- The subject can describe the arousal and valence of the emotional stimulus in real time
- StimuliXpert also includes a variety of tools which are included in the **Analysis** window and can be used to process the recorded data

**The same stimulus causes different arousal to each subject, whenever common attributes are found, so the StimuliXpert helps the user to describe his/her Arousal and Valence that he/she felt during the experiments**

The latest official release of StimuliXpert can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/GeorgeGiannopoulos/StimuliXpert/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
